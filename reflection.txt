I have learnt that the development of artificial intelligence have ad 3 stages of connectionism and they rise and falls. I have also learnt that the hardest things to do well for a human is the easiest thing to do for a robot when programmed. What I also find interesting is that there were people already thinking about ways to humanise objects
That are not humans to try to improve the lives of the people back then.
